# ðŸš¦ Traffic-simulation ðŸš¦
this is a simple traffic simulation where you can build your own city design and see where traffic will become an issue. <br />
With this project i wanted to learn how to create autonomous cars based on a behavior tree.<br />
but also keep a flexible world enviroment that i can change to see how these cars would interact in different worlds.<br />

<br />
**âš still in developmentâš **
<br />
As of 8/01/2022 i am still coding the simulator, the following list gives you an idea of what i have done so far.


 ## **âœ“  done & to do  âœ“**
- create road textures âœ“
- create world grid âœ“
- create car texture âœ“
- create car(functionalety) âœ“
- create traffic rules(priorety for righthand cars,...)âœ–
- create home/factory textures(also placeable) âœ“
- create traffic lights âœ–


### ðŸ’¡how does it workðŸ’¡
**first you create a road network** <br />

**then you add houses/factories** <br />

**Whenever you want press space to start simulating** <br />
âš if there is a house/factory not connected to a road it will freeze(il fix this after i create the traffic rules)
