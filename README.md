# ðŸš¦ Traffic-simulation ðŸš¦
this is a simple traffic simulation where you can build your own city design and see where traffic will become an issue. 
<br />
**âš still in developmentâš **
<br />
As of 8/01/2022 i am still coding the simulator, the following list gives you an idea of what i have done so far.


 ## **âœ“  done & to do  âœ“**
- create road textures âœ“
- create world grid âœ“
- create car texture âœ“
- create car(functionalety) âœ“
- create traffic rules(priorety for righthand cars,...)âœ–
- create home/factory textures(also placeable) âœ“
- create traffic lights âœ–


### ðŸ’¡how does it workðŸ’¡
**first you create a road network** <br />

**then you add houses/factories** <br />
